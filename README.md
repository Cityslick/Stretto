Code Snippet:
...Code for Index method with multiple API calls being parsed into JSON

```
def index
        @seatgeek = Rails.application.secrets.seat_geek_api_key || ENV['SEAT_GEEK_API_KEY']
        response = HTTParty.get("https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events?sort=score.desc&q=music+festival&per_page=52&client_id=#{@seatgeek}") 
        recent = HTTParty.get("https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events?sort=datetime_utc.asc&q=music+festival&per_page=52&client_id=#{@seatgeek}") 
        near = HTTParty.get("https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events?sort=datetime_utc.asc&q=music+festival&per_page=52&geoip=true&client_id=#{@seatgeek}")
        newly_announced = HTTParty.get("https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events?sort=announce_date.desc&q=music+festival&per_page=25&client_id=#{@seatgeek}")  
        @res = JSON.parse response.to_s, symbolize_names: true
        @recent = JSON.parse recent.to_s, symbolize_names: true
        @near = JSON.parse near.to_s, symbolize_names: true
        @newly = JSON.parse newly_announced.to_s, symbolize_names: true
    end
